        <h2>What is Full Stack Development?</h2>
        <p>
            Full stack development is a software development approach where the developer handles both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) of a web application. The front-end includes everything users see and interact withâ€”HTML, CSS, JavaScriptâ€”while the back-end deals with databases, servers, APIs, and application logic. Full stack developers have the versatility to work across the entire software stack, making them valuable for building and maintaining complete web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Explore this full stack app tutorial that demonstrates how the front end and back end work together.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all web pages. It provides structure to the content using elements like headings (&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), images (&lt;img&gt;), and lists (&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;). HTML5 brought new semantic elements like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt;, making it easier for browsers and assistive technologies to understand the page's structure. A well-structured HTML document ensures accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

    <section id="css">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of web pages. With CSS, developers can apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts to HTML elements. Modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid make it much easier to build responsive designs. CSS also supports animations and media queries, which help tailor a siteâ€™s appearance to different devices and screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Hereâ€™s a working demo showing CSS Flexbox in action for layout.

        <h2>Bootstrap Framework</h2>
        <p>
            Bootstrap is a widely used front-end framework that provides pre-designed components like navbars, buttons, cards, and modals. It also includes a responsive grid system that simplifies layout design. Bootstrapâ€™s built-in responsiveness ensures that websites look great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops, with minimal custom code. Developers use Bootstrap to prototype quickly and maintain design consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Explore this Bootstrap example page with responsive cards and navbar.

    <section id="javascript">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the scripting language that makes web pages interactive. It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically, respond to user events, fetch data from APIs, and much more. JavaScript is at the core of modern web development, and popular libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular are built on top of it. With JavaScript, you can build everything from simple form validation to complex web applications.
